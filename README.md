## Playing the game

Start up by pressing play, then new game*!! This will put you in the main game, and you have to go around to defeat enemies and look around the area! Currently, the only area available is the suburbs.

When you are given a story, it is simply just a joke for entertainment.

When you are given a choice, you can decline for a small reward or you could accept for a chance at a bigger reward.

When you are in a fight, you must either die or defeat the enemy to move on.
